Updates on LLM implementation:
  <br/>
Added free (no credit card needed) Hugging Face LLM agent. 
 <br/>
Need to descover if I can choose the right dataset and limit the responses by prompts to meet the app specific needs.
 <br/>
Hugging Face is generally considered a safe and reliable platform for using machine learning models and tools in your projects. 
It hosts a vast collection of pre-trained models, datasets, and libraries that can be easily integrated into various applications.
 <br/>
Hugging Face's LLM (Large Language Model) agents work by utilising pre-trained transformer models. 
 <br/>
These models are trained on massive amounts of text data and can perform various natural language processing tasks such as text generation, translation, and question answering. 
 <br/>
The agents use these models to understand and respond to user inputs, generate text, and interact with other tools or APIs.
